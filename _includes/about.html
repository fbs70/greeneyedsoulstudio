                  <p>I create limited and one of a kind wearable art that is classic and edgy. The power of possibility inspires me to explore and create wearable art.</p>

                  <p>Jewelry embodies the spirit of an individual. A woman’s jewelry box represents the chapters in her life. You will see throughout my collection that each piece creates its own mood, energy, or attitude. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder</p>

                  <p>All of my fine silver pendants are handmade by me using PMC (.999 fine silver). My finishing techniques are traditional on most, but some pieces I took a nontraditional approach to give it a style or attitude of its own. I’m always open to custom orders and I would love to design something just for you!</p>

                  <p>Thank you for taking the time,<br />
